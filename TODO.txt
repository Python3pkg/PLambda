1.[X] Allow for verbosity in the pyactor (thus need to implement UPDATE,
but can LOOKUP be ignored? Also do we need SUPDATE at all?).

Actually I think the more pythonesque translation is to drop
the UPDATE clan and use GETATTR and SETATTR instead.

Done.


2.[X] What would a good install look like? Make use if IOPBINDIR I suppose.
Or go the pip route?  PIP I think. Might make a pip branch first.


3.[X] Maybe being able to pass a dictionary to invoke and apply instead
of arguments might solve the kwargs issue? or have an INVOKEKARWGS
or some such form (CALL).

added KWAPPLY

4.[X] Literals like:  {}  [] ?   mktuple ?

mktuple mklist mkdict get


5.[X] Destructive updates to dicts and lists.

added MODIFY

6.[X] Single quotes as string delimiters...


7.[X] What is wrong with:

"\\" ?


8.[X]   General solution to PLambda Python name clashes.

global(x)


9.  getattr setattr vs lookup and update. 

moving back to lookup and update would reduce the number of clashes.

still undecided here. currently LOOKUP, UPDATE and SUPDATE should work.

10. Figure out why we can't call mainloop from the plambda REP.

argspec ['n'] ??


11.  Console loose ends:

      - [X] view menuitems
      - [X] open and save as
      - search?  [Meh]

      - [X] focus on end in output text area
