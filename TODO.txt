1. Allow for verbosity in the pyactor (thus need to implement UPDATE,
but can LOOKUP be ignored? Also do we need SUPDATE at all?).

Actually I think the more pythonesque translation is to drop
the UPDATE clan and use GETATTR and SETATTR instead.



2. What would a good install look like? Make use if IOPBINDIR I suppose.


3. Maybe being able to pass a dictionary to invoke and apply instead
of arguments might solve the kwargs issue?

4. Literals like:  {}  [] ?   mktuple ?
