1.[X] Allow for verbosity in the pyactor (thus need to implement UPDATE,
but can LOOKUP be ignored? Also do we need SUPDATE at all?).

Actually I think the more pythonesque translation is to drop
the UPDATE clan and use GETATTR and SETATTR instead.

Done.


2. What would a good install look like? Make use if IOPBINDIR I suppose.
Or go the pip route? Pip route. Need to make the entry points match
the setup.py script.


3. Maybe being able to pass a dictionary to invoke and apply instead
of arguments might solve the kwargs issue? or have an INVOKEKARWGS
or some such form (CALL).

4.[X] Literals like:  {}  [] ?   mktuple ?
