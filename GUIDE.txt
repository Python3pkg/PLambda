[[Construction Zone: please feel free to add questions]]

The main differences between Java and Python from the perspective
of PLambda/JLambda are:

   0. python is interpreted

   1. the import mechanism is required, and modules, and classes, are first
      class objects.

   2. the untyped primitive data structures (tuple, list, dictionary) can store
   objects and numbers etc.

   3. there are global functions, which you can just apply.

   4. no 'new' operator, just apply the constructor.

   5. richer argument passing (not implemented yet).

   6. python things are already attributable (why do we need uids and fetch?)

1 and  3 combine to allow us to have a richer use of the '.' in PLambda
than in JLambda, we even combine it with the define mechanism.

2 makes life very much easier.
