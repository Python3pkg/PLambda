The main differences between Java and Python from the perspective
of PLambda JLambda are:

   0. python is interpreted

   1. the import mechanism is required, and modules, and classes, are first
      class objects.

   2. the untyped primitive data structures (tuple, list, dictionary)

   3. there are global functions


1 and  3 combine to allow us to have a richer use of the '.' in PLambda
than in JLambda. 2 makes life very much easier.
